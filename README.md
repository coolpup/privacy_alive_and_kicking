##Privacy: what is it and why does it matter?



###What is privacy?


There are a number of varying definitions of privacy.  The meaning of privacy may also differ based on context; privacy in the legal sense may not be the same as privacy in the philosophical sense.  Several definitions of them center on similar points.  Ultimately privacy may not have the same meaning to you as it does to me or to others, but the following sources may be able to communicate this message more effectively.


#####From a crowdsourced encyclopedia:

>**Privacy** is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves, or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively. The boundaries and content of what is considered private differ among cultures and individuals, but share common themes. When something is private to a person, it usually means that something is inherently special or sensitive to them.
>
>_[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy "Entry for privacy")_


#####From an encyclopedia of philosophy

>The term _privacy_ is used frequently in ordinary language as well as in philosophical, political and legal discussions, yet there is no single definition or analysis or meaning of the term. The concept of privacy has broad historical roots in sociological and anthropological discussions about how extensively it is valued and preserved in various cultures. ... Privacy can refer to a sphere separate from government, a domain inappropriate for governmental interference, forbidden views and knowledge, solitude, or restricted access, to list just a few.

#####From a professional association:

>Broadly speaking, privacy is the right to be let alone, or freedom from interference or intrusion. Information privacy is the right to have some control over how your personal information is collected and used.

#####From activist group:

>Privacy enables us to create barriers and manage boundaries to protect ourselves from unwarranted interference in our lives, which allows us to negotiate who we are and how we want to interact with the world around us. Privacy helps us establish boundaries to limit who has access to our bodies, places and things, as well as our communications and our information.

#####From a published law review:

>These considerations lead to the conclusion that the protection afforded to thoughts, sentiments, and emotions, expressed through the medium of writing or of the arts, so far as it consists in preventing publication, is merely an instance of the enforcement of the more general right of the individual to be let alone.

#####From another published law review

>What has emerged from the decisions is no simple matter. It is not one tort, but a complex of four ... described as follows:
>
> 1. Intrusion upon the plaintiff's seclusion or solitude, or into his private affairs.
> 2. Public disclosure of embarrassing private facts about the plaintiff.

>
>And with that comes a desire to protect our privacy and our data—you want to share your lives with the people you choose. I sure do. But the FBI has a sworn duty to keep every American safe from crime and terrorism, and technology has become the tool of choice for some very dangerous people.

>For an activity to be private in these ways, it needs only to be hidden; the concealment ... can be quite local: other people may readily know what someone, in private, is doing. Other kinds of privacy involve secrecy, as with the undisclosed transactions that take place in a family or among friends. Often, of course, as with other secrets, they are not so much undisclosed as unacknowledged, and what is indecent or embarrassing is to show that one knows. ... In still other cases, experience is private because it is free from demands or obligations imposed by others. One is free to read, or to go to the movies, or to travel where one wants. This need not have anything specially to do with hiddenness or secrecy.
>
>_[Bernard Williams](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1985/04/25/private-faces-and-public-places/ "Private Faces and Public Places")_


#####From a psychologist
>Privacy is an outcome of a person's wish to withhold from others certain knowledge as to his past and present experience and action and his intentions for the future. The wish for privacy expresses a desire to be an enigma to others or, more generally, a desire to control others' perceptions and beliefs vis-a'-vis the self-concealing person. A man may seek to elude others' direct experience of his action, and he may seek to distort or misrepresent his experiencing to others in order that their view of him will not coincide with his direct view and knowledge of himself.

###Why does privacy matter?


>Freedom from surveillance, whether public or private, is foundational to the practice of informed and reflective citizenship.  Privacy therefore is an indispensable structural feature of liberal democratic political systems.  Freedom from surveillance also is foundational to the capacity for innovation, and so the perception of privacy as anti-innovation is a non sequitur. ... In short, privacy incursions harm individuals, but not only individuals. Privacy incursions in the name of progress, innovation, and ordered liberty jeopardize the continuing vitality of the political and intellectual culture that we say we value.
>
>_[What Privacy Is For](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2175406 "Harvard Law Review, Vol. 126, 2013 - Julie E. Cohen")_


>The law hasn’t kept pace with technology, and this disconnect has created a significant public safety problem. We call it “Going Dark,” and what it means is this: Those charged with protecting our people aren’t always able to access the evidence we need to prosecute crime and prevent terrorism even with lawful authority. We have the legal authority to intercept and access communications and information pursuant to court order, but we often lack the technical ability to do so. ... Encryption is nothing new. But the challenge to law enforcement and national security officials is markedly worse, with recent default encryption settings and encrypted devices and networks—all designed to increase security and privacy.

#####Sociologist/Dramatologist
>[Front stage is] that part of the individual's performance which regularly functions in a general and fixed fashion we define the situation for those who observe the performance. Front, then, is the expressive equipment of a standard kind intentionally or unwittingly employed by the individual during his performance. ... [Back stage is where] the performer can relax; he can drop his front, forgo speaking in his lines, and step out of character. ... [Outside, or off-stage, is the place where individuals are not involved in the performance (although they may not be aware of it).]
>
>_Erving Goffman "The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life"_


#####Encyclopedia of Philosophy
>Human beings value their privacy and the protection of their personal sphere of life. They value some control over who knows what about them. They certainly do not want their personal information to be accessible to just anyone at any time. But recent advances in information technology threaten privacy and have reduced the amount of control over personal data and open up the possibility of a range of negative consequences as a result of access to personal data. The 21st century has become the century of Big Data and advanced Information Technology allows for the storage and processing of exabytes of data.

>I've debated this issue around the world, every single time somebody has said to me, "I don't really worry about invasions of privacy because I don't have anything to hide." I always say ... "Here's my email address. What I want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts, not just the nice, respectable work one in your name, but all of them, because I want to be able to just troll through what it is you're doing online, read what I want to read and publish whatever I find interesting. After all, if you're not a bad person, if you're doing nothing wrong, you should have nothing to hide." **Not a single person has taken me up on that offer.**
>
>_[Glenn Greenwald](http://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters "Why Privacy Matters")_


>To be fair to privacy advocates, we have a good excuse. It’s really hard to get people to care about dangers that are far in the future, especially when the action that puts you in danger and the consequences of that action are separated by an unbridgeable gap of time and space. Privacy disclosures are a public health problem, like smoking. No one puff on a cigarette will definitely give you cancer, but take enough puffs and you’ll virtually guarantee cancer, eventually. No one act of disclosure of personal information will harm you, but once enough disclosures have taken place, over enough time, you’re going to get into serious privacy trouble.

>_[Cory Doctorow](http://www.locusmag.com/Perspectives/2016/07/cory-doctorow-peak-indifference/ "Peak Indifference")_


>Privacy protects us from abuses by those in power, even if we're doing nothing wrong at the time of surveillance. ... We are not deliberately hiding anything when we seek out private places for reflection or conversation. We keep private journals, sing in the privacy of the shower, and write letters to secret lovers and then burn them. Privacy is a basic human need.
>
>A future in which privacy would face constant assault was so alien to the framers of the Constitution that it never occurred to them to call out privacy as an explicit right. ... You watched convicted criminals, not free citizens. You ruled your own home. It's intrinsic to the concept of liberty.

##Lessons from history


>Indicators of the lifestyle of the house's occupants can be gleaned from their construction, favouring spatial seclusion and separation. Exterior walls continued a single street door, and high windows, both practical for reasons of security where opened directly onto busy roads. Views into the house were dark and narrow, and angled into hallway spaces,blocking views further into the house from the street outside. Suites of rooms, some interconnecting, opened onto a central courtyard space,which provided the main sourceof light for the house. ... Interior windows provided light rather than observation portals, as much of the ground floor would have been in darkness.

>So I would not go so far as to simply baldly assert that privacy is dead, although Scott McNealy said that about 15 years ago and I think that was almost an exact quote. But let me tell you that it will be increasingly difficult for us to achieve privacy. I want you to think for just a minute that privacy may actually be an anomaly. I don't know whether any of you have lived in small towns, but I lived in a little town in Germany of 3,000 people in 1962. The postmaster knew pretty much what everybody was doing because he saw all of the letters going back and forth. And oh, by the way, nobody had telephones at home ... on top of that, in the town of 3,000 people, there is no privacy. Everybody knows what everybody is doing.

##Paradigms to make informed decisions
About privacy-related matters


>Controlling a social situation in an effort to achieve privacy is neither easy nor obvious. Doing so requires power, knowledge, and skills. First, people must have a certain degree of agency or power within a social situation, which means that they must either have social status or take measures to effectively resist those who are more powerful within that situation. Second, people must have a reasonable understanding of the social situation and context in which they are operating. And third, people must have the skills to manage the social situation in order to both understand and affect how information flows and is interpreted. These prerequisites for achieving privacy can be overwhelming. Furthermore, they are often taken for granted by those questioning why [people] don’t do more to manage their privacy.

>Threat modeling is a process by which potential threats can be identified, enumerated, and prioritized – all from a hypothetical attacker’s point of view. The purpose of threat modeling is to provide defenders with a systematic analysis of the probable attacker’s profile, the most likely attack vectors, and the assets most desired by an attacker. Threat modeling answers the questions “Where are the high-value assets?” “Where am I most vulnerable to attack?” “What are the most relevant threats?” “Is there an attack vector that might go unnoticed?”

>Conceptually, most people incorporate some form of threat modeling in their daily life and don’t even realize it. Commuters use threat modeling to consider what might go wrong during the morning drive to work and to take preemptive action to avoid possible accidents.

>This "notice and consent" model is absurd on its face, and yet it is surprisingly legally robust. As I write this in July of 2016, US federal appellate courts have just ruled on two cases that asked whether End User Licenses that no one read and no one understands and no one takes seriously are enforceable. The cases differed a little in their answer, but in both cases, the judges said that they were enforceable at least some of the time (and that violating them can be a felony!).

>These rulings come down as the entirety of America has been consumed with Pokémon Go fever, only to have a few killjoys like me point out that merely by installing the game, all those millions of players have "agreed" to forfeit their right to sue any of Pokémon's corporate masters should the com­panies breach all that private player data. You do, however, have 30 days to opt out of this forfeiture; if Pokémon Go still exists in your timeline and you signed up for it in the past 30 days, send an e-mail to with the subject "Arbitra­tion Opt-out Notice" and include in the body "a clear declaration that you are opting out of the arbitration clause in the Pokémon Go terms of service."

##Detractors that are the result of privacy choices


###Time factor
- Setup
	- Installing software/hardware for privacy takes time
- Regular use
- Changing policies and features


> It’s  hard  to  develop  the  skills  to  manage  how  information will flow within a social situation when the underlying  affordances change regularly. For example, when sites like Facebook  repeatedly alter their privacy settings, developing the necessary skills  to  manage  how  visible  content  should  be  becomes,  if  not  next  to  impossible,  then  incredibly  labor-intensive.

##Tools to use
To enact privacy choices


###Web browsers
- [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
    - [Firefox hardening](https://github.com/pyllyukko/user.js)
    - [Privacy Settings Addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-settings/)


###Getting started:

    privacy.trackingprotection.enabled = true
        This is Mozilla’s new built in tracking protection.
    geo.enabled = false
        Disables geolocation.
    browser.safebrowsing.enabled = false
        Disable Google Safe Browsing and phishing protection. Security risk, but privacy improvement.
    browser.safebrowsing.malware.enabled = false
        Disable Google Safe Browsing malware checks. Security risk, but privacy improvement.
    dom.event.clipboardevents.enabled = false
        Disable that websites can get notifications if you copy, paste, or cut something from a web page, and it lets them know which part of the page had been selected.
    network.cookie.cookieBehavior = 1
        Disable cookies
        0 = Accept all cookies by default
        1 = Only accept from the originating site (block third party cookies)
        2 = Block all cookies by default
    network.cookie.lifetimePolicy = 2
        cookies are deleted at the end of the session
        0 = Accept cookies normally
        1 = Prompt for each cookie
        2 = Accept for current session only
        3 = Accept for N days
    browser.cache.offline.enable = false
        Disables offline cache.
    browser.send_pings = false
        The attribute would be useful for letting websites track visitors’ clicks.
    webgl.disabled = true
        WebGL is a potential security risk. Source
    dom.battery.enabled = false
        Website owners can track the battery status of your device. Source
    browser.sessionstore.max_tabs_undo = 0
        Even with Firefox set to not remember history, your closed tabs are stored temporarily at Menu -> History -> Recently Closed Tabs.
